# Fragments

Fragments allow for the creation of the user interface for an android application in a versatile way.

A Fragment has an associated view hierarchy just like an Activity. 

Fragments are contained within an activity and only exist within the context of an activity. 
Fragments could be thought of as "fragmented" or "mini" activities. 
A Fragment is extended from android.app.Object where as an Activity from Context.

Fragments have a life cycle like any other Android component. 

Fragments were released in Android 3.0. A fragment SDK that works on old Android devices was also released by Google.

An Activity specifies Fragments as containers in its layout. The internal structure of each Fragment is laid out in its own layout file that specifies the Fragment's view hierarchy.
