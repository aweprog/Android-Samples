### Custom Adapters

An adapter manages a data source and provides views populated with data to an AdapterView. 

Custom Adapters are needed
* to have more control over how child views are displayed
* to implement techniques like caching for improving performance
* to manage data in a customized way

To implement a custom adapter, extend the abstract class <b>BaseAdapter</b> and provide custom implementation.
